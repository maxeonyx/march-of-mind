# March of Mind - Game Development Plan

## Key Design Principles

1. **Always Have A Button To Click**: At every stage, there should be an obviously satisfying button that gives immediate feedback and reward, though not necessarily the optimal strategy.

2. **Progressive Unlocks**: New mechanics should be introduced at a pace that keeps the player engaged, with each unlock building on existing systems.

3. **Historical Progression**: The game follows AI development from the 1950s onwards through discoveries and products.

4. **Balanced Resource Management**: Players must make meaningful choices about resource allocation with no single optimal strategy.

5. **Satisfying Feedback Loops**: Every action should provide immediate visual and numerical feedback to create a sense of accomplishment.

6. **Educational Component**: Players must answer multiple-choice questions in modal windows to unlock technologies and products, reinforcing learning about AI history.

7. **Exponential Compute**: Hardware improvements demonstrate the exponential growth of computing power throughout AI history.

## Game Progression Flow

### Game Duration
The complete game experience is designed to take approximately 40 minutes from start to finish. This translates to:
- Roughly 30 seconds per game year
- 2.5 seconds per game month
- A total span from 1950 to 2035 (85 years)

Note: The 2035 end date is a target for game pacing rather than a hard end date. It represents roughly when a player would develop superintelligent AI in the game narrative, but gameplay continues beyond this point.

### Phase 1: Research Phase
- **Core Mechanic**: Single "Research" button that generates insights
- **Satisfaction**: Watching insights number increase
- **Click Action**: The research button itself
- **Progression Goal**: Earn enough insights to discover first AI technology (Mark 1 Perceptron)
- **Fun Factor**: Simple but addictive number growth, anticipation of discovery
- **Educational**: Answer multiple-choice question to unlock first discovery

### Phase 2: Lab Phase
- **New Mechanics**:
  - Hardware acquisition system (primary resource)
  - Insights generation based on hardware FLOP/s
  - Product development capability
  - Income generation through products
  - Researcher (talent) acquisition
- **Satisfaction**: Building your lab, seeing first product created
- **Click Action**: Research button generating insights, product development
- **Progression Goal**: Complete products to generate income for hardware and researchers
- **Fun Factor**: Balancing hardware upgrades with researcher hiring
- **Educational**: Answer questions to unlock new hardware and products

### Phase 3: Discovery Phase
- **New Mechanics**:
  - Products generate income
  - "Marketing" button appears
  - Salary/savings allocation slider
- **Satisfaction**: Making new discoveries, growing income
- **Click Action**: Research button and marketing button (strategic choice)
- **Progression Goal**: Balance product portfolio with valuable discoveries
- **Fun Factor**: Strategic depth, historical progression, enhanced capabilities
- **Educational**: Answer increasingly complex questions about AI concepts

### Phase 4: AGI Phase
- **New Mechanics**:
  - Talent and hardware panels merge
  - Dramatically accelerated hardware upgrade rates
  - Rapid discovery of advanced technologies
- **Satisfaction**: Experiencing technological singularity-like acceleration
- **Click Action**: Rapid hardware upgrades and discoveries
- **Progression Goal**: Continue accelerating technological progress
- **Fun Factor**: Exponential growth and system integration

## Core Game Systems

### Insight System
- Primary resource generated by research button
- Generation rate = Research Labor × Hardware FLOP/s + Discovery Bonuses
- Used for:
  - Making discoveries
  - Developing products
  - Unlocking new technologies

### Hardware System
- Progression through historical computing milestones (vacuum tubes → transistors → integrated circuits, etc.)
- Each upgrade requires educational modal with content and questions
- Upgraded with money from product income
- Exponentially increases FLOP/s with each upgrade
- Directly multiplies insight generation rate
- Always visible upgrade button showing progress

### Income System
- Generated exclusively through products
- No direct "work for money" mechanics
- Used for:
  - Hiring researchers (talent)
  - Purchasing hardware upgrades
  - Allocated via slider between salaries and savings

### Researcher System (renamed from Talent)
- Hired with income from products
- Contributes to:
  - Research labor (insight generation)
  - Product development speed
- Paid through salary allocation slider

### Products System
- Developed using Insights
- Generate income once completed
- Income can be boosted through marketing
- Based on real-world AI applications in chronological order
- Each product has specific requirements and income generation potential
- Requires answering multiple-choice question to unlock
- Always leaf nodes in the tech tree (never prerequisites)

### Discoveries System
- Unlocked through research efforts
- Based on actual historical AI breakthroughs
- Form internal nodes in the tech tree (prerequisites for other discoveries and products)
- Provides various benefits:
  - Enhances insight generation rate
  - Product-specific bonuses
  - Unlocks potential for new product types
  - Improves research efficiency
- Requires answering educational questions to unlock
- Does not directly generate income

### Tech Tree System
- Structured as a directed graph of technologies
- Discoveries serve as internal nodes (prerequisites)
- Products serve as leaf nodes (income generators)
- Progression follows rough chronological order of AI development
- Initial development uses very short tech tree (1-2 minutes playthrough)
- Final version will have comprehensive tech tree (40-minute experience)

### Resource Allocation System
- Interactive slider to distribute income between:
  - Researcher salaries (0 to maximum affordable with current income)
  - Savings for hardware upgrades
- Slider range increases with income but doesn't auto-adjust
- Creates meaningful strategic choices
- Different allocations favor different progression paths

### Marketing System
- Active clicking action after establishing products
- Provides temporary boosts to product income
- Diminishing returns on frequent clicks
- Always beneficial to some degree

## UI/UX Elements

### Main Dashboard
- Clean, modern interface resembling a research lab dashboard
- Prominent resource counters (insights, income)
- Clear visualization of resource generation rates
- Phase-appropriate action buttons

### Hardware Interface
- Visual representation of current computing system
- FLOP/s metrics
- Upgrade button with progress indicator
- Historical context for each hardware generation

### Educational Modals
- Appear when technologies/products become available to unlock
- Include historical context and educational content about AI concepts
- Present multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty
- Required to unlock new technologies and products

### Product Development Interface
- Visual representation of products in development
- Progress indicators
- Insight requirements
- Income projections

### Discovery Interface
- Historical timeline of AI discoveries
- Current research progress
- Benefits of each potential discovery
- Tech tree visualization

### Marketing Interface
- Product performance metrics
- Marketing effectiveness visualization
- Return on investment indicators
